Asciinemas for games:
1. Brain-even:
    https://asciinema.org/a/1690tLC5kGIcpktm0YpKdIg1Q

2. Brain-calc:
    https://asciinema.org/a/FDWQZBMUd6OEQfjU6J95Tc7q5

    "Brain calc". The user is shown a random mathematical expression, for example, which needs to be calculated and the correct answer written down.

3. Brain-gcd:
    https://asciinema.org/a/uVF6x0Pi2G75baGLhrGApmb7q

    "Brain gcd". The user is shown two random numbers and must calculate and enter the greatest common divisor of these numbers.

4. Brain-prime:
    https://asciinema.org/a/xsMTuTX97G2H6G1Ew6CNsFrgl

    "Brain prime" The user is given a number and must answer whether it is prime or not. Simple numbers are numbers that divide without remainder only by one and themselves.

5. Brain-progression:
    https://asciinema.org/a/jwpkF0KNDGabjknsb2W5umKoh
